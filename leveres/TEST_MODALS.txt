🔍 TEST MODAL CLOSING:

For each modal, verify it closes when:
  ✓ Clicking the X button (top right)
  ✓ Clicking the Cancel button (bottom left)
  ✓ Pressing ESC key on keyboard
  ✓ Clicking outside the modal (on backdrop)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

OPENING:
  - Modal appears smoothly
  - Background is dimmed/blurred
  - Page scroll is disabled
  - Form is empty and ready

SUBMITTING:
  - Required fields are validated
  - Form submits to server
  - Modal closes after success
  - New item appears in table
  - Success message shows (if applicable)

CLOSING:
  - Modal disappears smoothly
  - Background returns to normal
  - Page scroll is restored
  - Form is reset (empty)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

ISSUE: Modal doesn't open
FIX: Clear cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

ISSUE: Form doesn't submit
FIX: Check required fields are filled

ISSUE: Background doesn't blur
FIX: Ensure Tailwind CSS is loaded properly

ISSUE: ESC key doesn't close modal
FIX: Click in modal first to focus it

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 TIPS:

- Test with keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, ESC)
- Try submitting empty form (validation should work)
- Test on mobile/tablet view if possible
- Verify form resets when reopening modal
