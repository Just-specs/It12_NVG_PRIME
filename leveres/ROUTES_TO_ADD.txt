# MANUAL ROUTE ADDITION GUIDE

The deletion approval system has been successfully implemented. However, the deletion request routes 
for individual resources need to be manually added to routes/web.php.

## Routes to Add:

### 1. In the DRIVERS section (around line 250):
After: Route::delete('/{driver}', [DriverController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
Add:
        Route::get('/{driver}/request-delete', [DriverController::class, 'requestDelete'])->name('requestDelete');
        Route::post('/{driver}/submit-delete-request', [DriverController::class, 'submitDeleteRequest'])->name('submitDeleteRequest');

### 2. In the VEHICLES section (around line 270):
After: Route::delete('/{vehicle}', [VehicleController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
Add:
        Route::get('/{vehicle}/request-delete', [VehicleController::class, 'requestDelete'])->name('requestDelete');
        Route::post('/{vehicle}/submit-delete-request', [VehicleController::class, 'submitDeleteRequest'])->name('submitDeleteRequest');

### 3. In the CLIENTS section (around line 290):
After: Route::delete('/{client}', [ClientController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
Add:
        Route::get('/{client}/request-delete', [ClientController::class, 'requestDelete'])->name('requestDelete');
        Route::post('/{client}/submit-delete-request', [ClientController::class, 'submitDeleteRequest'])->name('submitDeleteRequest');

### 4. In the DELIVERY REQUESTS section (around line 95, inside the CheckRole middleware):
After: Route::delete('/{request}', [DeliveryRequestController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
Add:
            Route::get('/{request}/request-delete', [DeliveryRequestController::class, 'requestDelete'])->name('requestDelete');
            Route::post('/{request}/submit-delete-request', [DeliveryRequestController::class, 'submitDeleteRequest'])->name('submitDeleteRequest');

Note: The requests section has 12 spaces of indentation (3 tabs) because it's inside a middleware group.

## How Head Dispatch Deletion Currently Works:

WITHOUT these routes:
- Head dispatch clicks delete ? Redirected to request-delete page ? 404 error

WITH these routes (once added):
- Head dispatch clicks delete ? Redirected to request-delete form ? Submits reason ? Admin approves/rejects

## What's Already Working:

? Admin can view all deletion requests at /deletion-requests
? Admin can approve/reject deletion requests
? Database table created
? Models and controllers created
? Views created
? Sidebar menu with notification badge
? Verification permissions updated (admin + head_dispatch can verify)

## Quick Fix Option:

If you have direct access to the file, simply open:
C:\IT12_project\IT12_updated\IT12-\routes\web.php

And add the 4 sets of routes shown above in their respective sections.

After adding, run:
php artisan route:clear
php artisan route:list | grep request-delete

You should see 8 new routes (2 per resource type).
