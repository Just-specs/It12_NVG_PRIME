Common Issues When Adding Drivers on Railway:

1. **CSRF Token Issue** (Same as trips assignment)
   - Symptom: Form submits but shows validation error
   - Cause: Session not configured for HTTPS
   - Solution: Already fixed with SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true

2. **Database Connection Issue**
   - Symptom: 500 error or "Connection refused"
   - Cause: Database not accessible
   - Check: Railway database is running

3. **License Number Unique Constraint**
   - Symptom: "The license number has already been taken"
   - Cause: Duplicate license number in database
   - Solution: Check existing drivers first

4. **Mobile/Phone Validation**
   - Symptom: "The mobile field is required"
   - Cause: Field validation fails
   - Solution: Check input format

5. **Status Enum Mismatch**
   - Symptom: "Invalid status value"
   - Cause: Status value not in enum
   - Solution: Use only: available, on-trip, off-duty

6. **Migration Not Run**
   - Symptom: "Table 'railway.drivers' doesn't exist"
   - Cause: Migrations haven't run on Railway
   - Solution: Run 'php artisan migrate --force'

7. **JavaScript/AJAX Error**
   - Symptom: Form doesn't submit, stays on page
   - Cause: JavaScript error or fetch() fails
   - Check: Browser console for errors
