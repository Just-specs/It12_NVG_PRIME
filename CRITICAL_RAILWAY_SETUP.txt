# CRITICAL: Railway Environment Variables Setup
# You MUST add these to Railway before drivers will work!

Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables Tab

Add EXACTLY these variables (copy-paste):

SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax
SESSION_DOMAIN=.railway.app
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=it12-prime-mover.up.railway.app,*.railway.app

After adding, Railway will auto-redeploy (takes 2-3 minutes).

IMPORTANT: Without these variables, the CSRF fix won't work!

Then test:
1. Go to https://it12-prime-mover.up.railway.app/drivers/create
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Fill in:
   - Name: Test Driver
   - Mobile: 09123456789
   - License: TEST2536
   - Status: Available
4. Click Save Driver
5. Check console for any errors

If still failing, tell me:
- What error message you see
- What's in the browser console (red errors)
- Status code in Network tab
